Global-Local Constraint Network for Foveal Avascular Zone Segmentation

Abstract:Recently, Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) emerges as a non-invasive and high-resolution imaging technique and plays a significant role in the diagnosis of ocular diseases. Foveal Avascular Zone (FAZ) serves as a crucial biomarker in the diagnosis of retinal diseases. However, there is a significant number of false positives (FPs) in the segmentation results of FAZ from existing methods. To address this issue,We have identified issues that were not discovered in other methods and propose a Global-Local Constraint network (GLCNet) for FAZ segmentation.


Note: Detailed code information will be made available upon publication of the "GLCNetï¼šGlobal-Local Constraint Network for Foveal Avascular Zone Segmentation" paper.
